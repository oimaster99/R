# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program is a simple movie rating manager in R. You can add movies and their rating, edit them, remove them, and plot all their ratings on a graph.

I wanted to write something cool in R. It fought me at every point. I hated wokring with this language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
